The goal of this Project is to develop an embedded system connected to a PC game. The PC game is about a guy who is riding a bycicle through the street, so when a hill shows up at the scene, the game send a signal through MQTT protocol to the system. The system, in turn, is composed by an Arduino, an ESP-01, a drive TB6600 and a stepper motor NEMA 17. Thus, ESP-01 receive the signal through MQTT and sends it to the Arduino board that is responsible for triggering the stepper motor.

In turn, the stepper motor will tight an exercise bike, getting hard to ride.
